						If you get me, you have to get a pond, as well. And who doesn't like ponds? You can even have some goldfish in there, so your cat can sit there amused for hours instead of vandalizing you garden.
					</p>
					<p class="about3">
						Also, if you invite friends and you don't like some of them, I can hide under my leaves when they come near me and go out there, when the nice ones come closer.
					</p>
					<p class="about4">
						If you're still reading this doubting if you reeeally need me in your garden, just look at me. Amn't I the most wonderful flower you've ever seen? Oh, come on. Get in your car and come pick me up at Berrie's Garden Centre.

						I am perfect for your garden, because

					<p class="about2">
						I am the most majestic little flower you've encountered in your whole life. Just look at me. I have flowers look alike roses, but mines are nice and bloomy and elegant and sweet-tempered.
					</p>
					<p class="about3">
						You're probably thinking about how can a flower be sweet-tempered. "You don't even have temper", some would say. Yes, I have. I didn't pick roses without a good reason. If you want to hurt them, they'd be like killing your hands with their thorns. If that's not temper, what is? I, on the other hand, would be kindly asking you not to be so rude with my gentle flowers.
					</p>
					<p class="about4">
						So, if you actually want a quiet, peaceful little garden, I'd rather choose me than some violant plant. It's your choice, but make sure to think of me, when your hands are bleeding because of those less lovely creatures.

						If you like the Netherlands, you can feel like you're already there just by looking at me. Pretty sweet, huh?
					</p>
					<p class="about3">
						Also, if you have instagram, you can post pictures of me every other day. People on instagram love tulips. I'd even risk saying they adore us. I mean, who doesn't?
					</p>
					<p class="about4">
						We are actually quite perfect. We come in every colour (yes, even black), we look extremely good in pictures, we get to be a bouquet just by ourselves, even only one of us look good. We are the best, really.

						Do I even have to say anything? Just look at me. Some call me heaven lotus, because I am so beautiful, that I am not even from this world.

					<p class="about3">
						You know how they say Gods only eat ambrosia. I look exactly like I am making ambrosia inside.
					</p>
					<p class="about4">
						Now that you know how amusing I am, you should be even more to the moon and back for me. Although, I have to warn you: I only like places where they treat me like a princess flower. If you don't treat me the way I should be treated, I'll tell the birds and they will rescue me. And when they do, trust me, you don't wanna be there.
